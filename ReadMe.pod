=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Pegex::CSV;

    my $list_of_lists = Pegex::CSV->new->load($csv);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a reasonable CSV parser written in Pegex.

The first draft was written at the Amsterdam.pm meeting on 9 Oct 2014, in 5
minutes or so during a live demo.

It was adapted for CPAN and made more complete on a train ride to Berlin
the next day.

The rather simple/elegant grammar can be found in C<share/csv.pgx>.
